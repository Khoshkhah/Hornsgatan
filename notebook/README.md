- `calib_discrete_example.ipynb`: Example of running the calibration (discrete) pipeline and analyzing results.
- `calib_example.ipynb`: Example of running the calibration pipeline and analyzing results.
- `sim_example.ipynb`: Example of running the simulation pipeline and visualizing simulation outputs.

Each notebook demonstrates:
- How to use the `HORNSGATAN_HOME` environment variable for paths
- How to run the pipeline from the notebook
- How to load and visualize results
